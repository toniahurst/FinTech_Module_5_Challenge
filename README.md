# FinTech_Module_5_Challenge

## Description

In this challenge, we built a tool to help credit union members evaluate their financial health. It allows clients to assess their monthly budgets and lets them forecast a reasonably effective retirement plan based on their current holdings of cryptocurrencies, stocks, and bonds. 

This Jupyter notebook provides a financial planner for emergencies so members can visualize their current savings and determine if they have enough reserves for an emergency fund (achieved when their Total Portfolio is >= $36,000).

The second part of this notebook provides a financial planner for retirement. I can be used to forecast the performance of a retirement portfolio in 30 years using Alpaca API calls via the Alpaca SDK and uses historical price data to generate Monte Carlo simulations. Through a second simulation in which the period is dropped to 10 years, the client can evaluate if an earlier retirement is wise or even possible.

## Technologies
This program uses Python 3.7.10, Pandas, Anaconda versionb 4.10.3, and JupyterLab 3.0.14. It also uses libraies from pandas, JSON, Dotenv, OS, MCForecast Tools and Alpaca Trade API. It was written on macOS Catalina 10.15.7.

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Lab notebook at https://github.com/toniahurst/FinTech_Module_5_Challenge/blob/main/Starter_Code_Module_5_Challenge/financial_planning_tools.ipynb or download the notebook and run from the CLI.
